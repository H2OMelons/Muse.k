<img src="./images/Restricted-Videos.PNG" align="left" width="35%">
<p>
  A restricted video is a video that a channel/company does not allow to be played
  outside of Youtube or if the video is not available in your region.

  If a video in your playlist is a restricted one and you try to play it,
  a notification will pop up on the right telling you that it's restricted and 
     give you the option to delete the video from your playlist and the next video 
     in the playlist will be automatically played.
